To find the correct version of software drivers, please first

1)  Identify your version of the Dreamplug via the white serial label affixed to the back of the unit. On this label, there is a 4 number sequence such as 1001 or 0901 in small block. The former refers to Version 10 Revision 1 and the latter is Version 9 Revision 1.

2)  After identifying the version of the Dreamplug, then download the appropriate version Wifi/Kernel/RTFS and associated drivers. V9 Dreamplugs can only use the V9 software payloads.
